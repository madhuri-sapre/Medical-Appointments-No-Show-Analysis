# Project Name
Medical-Appointments-No-Show-Analysis


# Description
This project explores 110k+  medical appointment records to understand why many patients do not show up for their scheduled appointments. Through detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the project identifies key factors influencing no-show behavior and provides insights to support better healthcare decision-making.


# Dataset:
•	Patient ID <br />
•	Gender <br />
•	Age <br />
•	Scheduled Date vs. Appointment Date <br />
•	Scholarship (Insurance) <br />
•	SMS Reminder <br />
•	Neighbourhood• No-Show Status <br />


# Objectives:
•	Analyze patient demographics and appointment characteristics <br />
•	Identify patterns behind missed appointments <br />
•	Examine how age, gender, waiting time, and SMS reminders affect attendance <br />
•	Provide insights to reduce no-show rates <br />


# Technologies Used:
•	Python (Pandas, NumPy)  <br /> 
•	Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn <br />
•	Jupyter Notebook <br />


# Key Findings:
•	Longer waiting time increases no-show likelihood <br />
•	Younger patients skip more appointments <br />
•	SMS reminders slightly improve attendance <br />
•	Some neighbourhoods show high no-show rates <br />
•	Scheduling delays strongly affect attendance <br />


# Workflow:
1.	Data cleaning & preprocessing <br />
2.	Handling missing/incorrect values <br />
3.	Feature engineering <br />
4.	Univariate and bivariate analysis <br />
5.	Visualizing trends & patterns <br />
6.	Insights and recommendations <br />


# Conclusion:
The analysis helps healthcare providers identify key risk indicators for appointment absenteeism and encourages data-driven strategies to reduce no-show rates. <br />
